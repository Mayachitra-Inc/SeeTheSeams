# SeeTheSeams
Localized Detection of Seam Carving based Image Forgery

## Introduction

Seam carving is a popular technique for content aware image retargeting. It can be used to deliberately manipulate images, for example, change the GPS locations of a building or insert/remove roads in a satellite image. This work presents a novel approach for detecting and localizing seams in such images. While there are methods to detect seam carving based manipulations, this is the first time that robust localization and detection of seam carving forgery has been made possible. We also propose a seam localization score (SLS) metric to evaluate the effectiveness of localization. The proposed method is evaluated extensively on a large collection of images from different sources, demonstrating a high level of detection and localization performance across these datasets. 

## Seam Carving Forgery

Seam carving is a popular image manipulation technique that is  effective for content aware image retargetting. In seam carving, the input image is resized by removing or inserting _seams_ which are defined as connected pixel paths from top-to-bottom or left-to-right. These seams are chosen by their optimality according to an energy function computed for each pixel. That is, the optimal seam is the seam with the lowest energy along its path. Commonly used energy functions in seam carving are computed by measuring the contrast of a pixel with its neighbors. Removing an optimal seam has fewer artifacts in resized images than a randomly chosen seam, and protects image content that is highly textured. Seam carving can be extended to remove entire objects from images by assigning the energy of object pixels to a low value such that the seams forcibly pass through the object marked for removal. Seam carving can also be used to displace an object in a given image by forcing the algorithm to remove seams from one side of the object and insert seams on the other side. Since seam carving leaves a large percentage of pixel values untampered, it poses a challenge to image forgery detection.

## Seam Carving Forensics

We propose a two stage, deep learning based seam carving detector with two key advantages over existing methods. The first advantage is the ability to _localize the seams_ at pixel level resolution. This is invaluable in discovering the extent of potential manipulations in satellite imagery. By considering the location of seams, one may be able to discover not only that an object may have been removed in an image, but where that removed object used to be. The second advantage is _generalizability_. Since image level classifiers are trained on original satellite images, they are prone to become specialized to the distribution of data they are trained on. We observed that our method is generalizable to not only training dataset distribution but different seam carving techniques.
